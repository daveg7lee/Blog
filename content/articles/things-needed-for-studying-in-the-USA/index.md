Before I begin, I must clarify that I am a student currently enrolled in an international school, and I have no knowledge of how students from Korean middle and high schools can apply to universities in the USA. Since I am in an international school, I could use my school grades directly for my application to American universities. Therefore, I advise you to look up how to use Korean school grades for admission to US universities separately.

What's the first thing you need to apply to a US university? Think about it, what's the most important thing for studying in college classes in the USA? Obviously, you need to know English. If you don't understand English, you wouldn't be able to follow the classes, and there would be no reason for the university to admit such a student.

# Official English Proficiency Test Score (TOEFL, Duolingo)

This is almost a mandatory requirement if you want to study abroad in the USA or other countries. Of course, there are slight differences in the tests required by each country, but most ask for scores from these official English proficiency tests. The most representative test is TOEFL, which stands for Test Of English as a Foreign Language. Its most significant feature is that it is organized by a private company called ETS and is quite expensive ($220, about 280,000 KRW). Another option is Duolingo, which is cheaper, easier than TOEFL, and doesn't charge additional fees for sending scores to universities (TOEFL charges an additional $20 for this).
Of course, I cannot say which is better or worse. Each test has its pros and cons, so I suggest taking both and choosing the one that suits you better. Honestly, if you are good at English, you can score high on any of these tests. I will share how I learned English in another article. (I will also disclose my TOEFL score then.)

What else do you need? Now that we know basic English proficiency is required, shouldn't we find out how well this student studies?

# Transcript

I don't know much about Korean admissions, but I think it wouldn't be much different. You need to send your grades to the university. Generally, US universities ask for grades from 9th to 12th grade, but this can vary slightly between universities (some may start from 10th grade), so I recommend checking this individually.
Once the transcript is sent, now it's time to write about the most important thing. I'm not sure how important this is in Korea, but in the USA, sometimes students with slightly lower grades get into good universities because of this.

# Essay

It may seem unbelievable that just by writing a good essay, you can get into a good university, but it's not about just writing well. You need to write so impressively that anyone would be amazed by it. Especially since US universities greatly value students' experiences (Experience), writing about your unique experiences can increase your chances of admission. Most applications are done through the Common App, so you'll find yourself writing one Common App Personal Essay and one or two essays for each university, soon feeling like a novelist. I recommend practicing writing regularly as it seems to improve with practice.
After writing the essay, a subject comes up that cannot be crammed at the last minute.

# Activities (Extracurriculars)

To get into a prestigious university, impressive activities are almost essential. These usually include activities related to your major, sports, various club activities, internships, etc. Since these cannot be developed overnight, it's important to start preparing consistently from 9th grade. As I plan to major in Computer Science, I mainly participated in related activities and often think it was a great choice.
One of the projects I worked on was called 'Submeet'.

It was a Music NFT Marketplace, and we had contracts with some entertainment companies, but it collapsed along with the NFT market. Regardless, it's important to highlight such activities.

# SAT or ACT

If there's the Korean SAT (CSAT) in Korea, there's the SAT and ACT in the USA. Why two tests? Because they are managed by two different private companies. Unlike the Korean SAT, which is a big event under strict government supervision, the US SAT and ACT feel quite different. Anyone can take these exams if they pay, and they are held several times a year. I couldn't take the SAT because my school didn't strongly encourage it, but many universities don't require the SAT due to the aftermath of COVID-19. However, if you're planning to study in the USA, consider the SAT or ACT essential. The SAT is the original and preferred by universities in the East Coast, but recently there's been little difference, so choose the test that suits you best.

# Conclusion

Apart from these five, there are a few other things like AP that are good to prepare, but these five are the essential elements. So, if you want to go to a US university, start studying English right now! I will explain more about English study in another article.
