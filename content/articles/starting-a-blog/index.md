I am a web developer currently studying at an international school in Gyeongsan, Gyeongbuk. People who don't know much about it often think I'm a prodigy for being a web developer as an international student, but I'm just a normal student. I still occasionally write on my blog. Like when I learn new development information or fix a really complex and difficult bug, you know? But this kind of content is not endless and it's hard to write. I feel pressured to provide in-depth information, which makes it hard to write frequently.

However, since I attend an international school, I know a lot about studying abroad, and being a developer, I'm sensitive to IT trends. Plus, I have a unique hobby of flying airplanes! I thought it would be good to write fun articles based on this information, so I started looking for a blog platform.

The first platform that came to mind was Tistory. As a developer, I naturally use Google, and Tistory and Velog often show up in Google search results. But Tistory has a big drawback – it only appears on Google and not on Naver. I decided to pass on it because what's the point if people don't read what I've worked hard to write.

Next was Naver Blog, the largest blog platform in Korea, but it's too ugly. Plus, there are too many spammy posts, which doesn't make me want to write there. Everyone knows that typical Naver Blog vibe...

Then I didn't have many choices left. Actually, there were almost none. If you want to blog in Korea, there are hardly any options other than these two platforms! Sure, there's Velog for developers and a few minor platforms, but let's consider them exceptions. That's when I discovered Brunch.

Anyone can write on Brunch, but it needs review for publication, a structure that can prevent the mass-produced posts I hated on Naver. Plus, I really liked Brunch's design – simple and clean, just the way I like.

I plan to keep posting on Brunch about study abroad, fighter jets & airplanes, development, and daily life, but I'm not sure if I'll pass the review. It seems like mostly light daily stories will be posted.
